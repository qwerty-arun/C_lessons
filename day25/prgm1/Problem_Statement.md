# Given two singly list both of which intersect at some point and become a single linked list. The head of both lists are know, but intersecting node is not known.  Also, the number of nodes in each of the lists before they intersect is unknown and may be different in eacch list. List 1 may have 'n' nodes before it reaches the intersection point and List 2 might have 'm' nodes before it reaches the intersection point. Give an algorithm for findign the merging point.
