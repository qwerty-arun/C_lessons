# PALINDROME STRINGS
A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string. For example, “abba” is a palindrome because the reverse of “abba” will be equal to “abba” so both of these strings are equal and are said to be a palindrome, but “abbc” is not a palindrome.
