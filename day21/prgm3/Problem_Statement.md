# WRITE A PROGRAM OR A FUNCTION WHICH FINDS IF THERE IS A LOOP WITHIN THE LIST
## If there is a loop, there are two nodes whose next pointers are the same. 
### Solution 1) Start with first node and see if there is a node whose next pointer is the current node's address. If there is a node with the same address then, that indicates that some other node is pointing to the current node and we can say loop exists. Problem: We might end up in an infinite loop. </br>
### Solution 2) Hash Table: Traverse the list one by one. Check if the address of the node is available in the hash table or not. If it already exists, then it indicates that there is a loop. If not available, then insert the address of the node in the table. Continue till we reach the end of the list or find a loop. Time: O(n) and Space: O(n). </br>
### Solution 3) Sorting technique: Collect the next addresses in a seperate array. Sort the array. If there is a loop in the list, there will be same addresses adjacent to each other. If such a pair occurs, then there is a loop. Problem: Infinite loop. Time: O(nlogn) for sorting next pointer array and Space: O(n). </br>
### Solution 4) Floyd Cycle finding algorithm: There are two pointers of different speeds, one jumps one ptr at a time and the other, two at a time. If there is a loop, both will happen to meet at some point or the other. Time: O(n) and Space: O(1). </br>
