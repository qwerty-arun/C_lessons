Why does the algorithm work?
In the Floyd cycle finding algorithm,
notice that the tortoise and the hare will meet when they are n × L, where L is the loop length.
Furthermore, the tortoise is at the midpoint between the hare and the beginning of the sequence
because of the way they move. Therefore the tortoise is n × L away from the beginning of the
sequence as well. If we move both one step at a time, from the position of the tortoise and from
the start of the sequence, we know that they will meet as soon as both are in the loop, since they
are n × L, a multiple of the loop length, apart. One of them is already in the loop, so we just move
the other one in single step until it enters the loop, keeping the other n × L away from it at all
times.
