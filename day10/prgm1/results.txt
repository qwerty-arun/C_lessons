1) MY SOLUTION FOR CHECKING IF TWO INTEGERS HAVE OPPOSIT SIGN
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int a=-1,b=2;
	int sign;
	sign=-(a*b>0); // 0 if they are of opposite sign and -1 if they are of same sign
	sign=-1*sign;//making -1, 1
	printf("%d\n",sign);
	return 0;
}

OUPUT: 0

IF INPUT a=1;b=2; 
OUPUT: 1
The next statement of sign is inefficient and is useless. 

2) BIT TWIDDLING HACKS SOLUTION
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int a=-1,b=2;
	bool sign = ((a ^ b) < 0); // true if x and y have opposite signs
	printf("%d\n",sign);
	return 0;
}

OUTPUT: 1
This solution is better as it computes in just one line.
