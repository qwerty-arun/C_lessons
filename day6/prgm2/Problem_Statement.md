# Find the array element having maximum frequency of digit K
Given an array arr[] of size N and an integer K, the task is to find an array element that contains the digit K a maximum number of times. If more than one solutions exist, then print any one of them. Otherwise, print -1.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {3, 77, 343, 456}, K = 3 
Output: 343 
Explanation: 
Frequency of 3 in array elements: 1, 0, 2, 0 
343 has maximum frequency i.e. 2.

Input: arr[] = {1, 1111, 111, 11}, K = 1 
Output: 1111 
Explanation: 
Frequency of 1 in array elements: 1, 4, 3, 2 
1111 has maximum frequency i.e. 4
