Most efficient approach: 
1) Find the lenghts (L1 and L2) of both lists - O(n) + O(m) = O(max(m,n)).
2) Take the difference d of the lengths - O(1)
3) Make d steps in the longer list.
4) Step in both list in parallel until links to next node match. O(min(m,n)).
5) Total time complexity: O(max(m,n))
6) Space complexity: O(1).
