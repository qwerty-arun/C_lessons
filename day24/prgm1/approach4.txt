Solving the problem using stacks:
1) Create two stacks: one for the first list and one for the second.
2) Traverse the first and push all the node addresses onto the first stack.
3) Traverse the second list and push all the node addresses onto the second stack.
4) Now both stacks contain the node address of the corresponding lists.
5) Now compare the top node address of the both stacks.
6) If they are the same, take the top elements from both the stacks and keep them in some temporary variable.
7) Continue this process until the top node addresses of the stacks are not the same.
8) This point is the one where the lists merge into a single list.
9) Return the value of the temporary variable.

Time Complexity: O(m+n) for scanning both the list.
Space Complexity: O(m+n) for creating two stacks for both the lists.
