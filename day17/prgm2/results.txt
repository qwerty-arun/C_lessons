For the program, the output is: 
45265612
29274

Why is the second one not 20? The reason is when the controll comes back from fun(), 'i' dies. So, even if we have its address in 'p', we can't access 'i' since it is already dead. If we want 'i' to survive, then we should declare it as 'static' .

For the modified program, the output is:
1007067184
20

Now, *p does hold the value of 'i' even after control comes back to calling function.
