Current Features of the circular list program:- 
1) Printing the elements
2) Find the length of the list
3) Insert node at the end of the list
4) Insert node at the front of the list

Drawbacks:- 
1) Doesn't accept no. of elements from the user
2) Doesn't have a seperate function for allocation of memory
3) Starting node condition
4) Doesn't have infinite while loop
5) No delete operation yet
